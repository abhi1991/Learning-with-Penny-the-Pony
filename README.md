TITLE:

<center><b>IMPLEMENTING THOMAS MALONE’S FRAMEWORK FOR A THEORY OF INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATING INSTRUCTION IN A GAME-BASED LEARNING TOOL FOR TODDLERS</b></center>

<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
Nowadays, many technological applications are flooding the market
most especially applications providing game-based learning or the so called
educational learning most especially for toddlers. GBL is a type of game
play that has defined learning outcomes. Some applications provide same
kind of concepts in their in their learning tool games. The main purpose of
this research paper is to provide a Game-Based Learning (GBL) tool using a
casual game approach, which is ideal for knowledge recalling. This GBL tool
will be based on the syllabus of the Little Champ Schoolhouse – a toddler
school located at Dona Candelaria St., Ecoland Subdivision, Davao City. The
key characteristics of an engaging Game-Based Learning was derived from
Thomas Malone’s Intrinsically Motivating Instruction Framework, which dwells
with the following: challenge, fantasy, and curiosity. Corona Software
Development Kit will be used in the development of this game-based
learning application in Android.

<b>Background of the Study</b>
<br>
Toddlers nowadays are exposed in using tablets or smartphones may it
be Android-based or iOS-based. With this being said, a Game-Based Learning
(GBL) tool in an Android gadget will be of help in teaching toddlers in a
creative manner. This will also allow the toddlers to be familiar with the
emerging technologies that there is.
The motivation for this study is to ease the method of learning for
toddlers and presenting it in a creative manner and not just sticking with the
traditional ones such as activity books/ worksheets. GBL is also a current
trend in education reform.
<br>
<br>
<b>Technology Application Context</b>
<br>
Nowadays, there are many Android applications flooding the market
that is categorized to be a Game-Based Learning. Game-Based Learning
(GBL) is a new trend in education reform. Games are now being used to learn
and teach and not just plainly for enjoyment. The proposed project will be an
Android game that will be created using a casual game approach, which is
ideal for knowledge recalling. With casual games, it can be easily used with
its simple rules. This GBL tool will be based on the syllabus of the Little
Champ Schoolhouse. The key characteristics of an engaging Game-Based
Learning, which was derived from Thomas Malone’s Intrinsically Motivating
Instruction, are as follows: challenge, fantasy, and curiosity.
In creating a GBL tool especially for toddlers, HCI with regards to its
user interface must be taken into consideration. Toddlers are said to be
attracted by warm, bright color schemes and that bright and cherry yellow is
associated with happiness and motivation and soft, subtle yellows promote
concentration while brighter shades can stimulate the memory. Kishotenketsu
Model will be used in creating the storyline of the game. Challenge and
reward system will be used for its scoring mechanisms. Positive words give
them self-esteem especially when they are being acknowledged when they
do something well. As the user finishes the set of challenges, he/she will be
able to unlock another level containing another set of tests. As the game
progresses, there will be more rewards and recognition.
In creating this learning tool, Corona SDK will be used integrated with
Lua in building it. This will be accompanied with Adobe Photoshop for
designing the GUI.
<br>
<br>
<b>Objectives of the Study</b>
<br>
The general objectives of this project are to develop an android
learning tool game for toddlers. The specific objectives are:
· To identify guidelines in creating the learning tool.
· To use Corona SDK in creating the whole application.
· To use Adobe Photoshop in embedding images for the creation of the
applications interface.
· To test the usability and effectiveness of the application for toddlers.
<br>
<br>
<b>Significance of the Study</b>
<br>
This study will be significant for developing an Android Application
using Corona SDK. Corona SDK was just released last January 2012 making
this SDK very fresh. This will also be helpful in presenting a Game-Based
Learning tool in an interactive manner. It was mentioned before that toddlers
are exposed in the different gadgets that are available in the market such as
smartphones, tablets and laptops. So, the proponents have decided to create
a GBL tool for in an Android-based gadget. In this manner, toddlers are not
just merely playing with the gadget but rest assured that learning is also
being done with this application.
<br>
<br>
<b>Scope and Limitations of the Study</b>
<br>
The scope of this study will be on creating a Game-Based Learning tool
that will be based on the curriculum of Little Champ Schoolhouse. For one,
this study will help in enhancing the memory retention of the kids using a
color scheme especially dedicated for that goal. This tool is only applicable
for gadgets powered by Android and this tool does not have to be connected
in the Internet in order to use it.
Since this learning tool is dedicated for toddlers, it is to be expected
that the games are for their age level and that it is more on repetition for the
exercise of the memory retention. The exercises provided will also be limited
on what was provided by the Little Champ Schoolhouse for the working year
of this project unless it will be updated for some new installments for new
exercises to be provided.
<br>
<br>
<b>Project Methodology</b>
<br>
The project methodology shows the steps taken to accomplish this
research study. This project was implemented based on Kishotenketsu Model
in creating the main storyline of the application. The whole project was
derived from Thomas Malone’s Intrinsically Motivating Instruction, which
discusses the following: challenge, fantasy, and curiosity.

7.1 Game-Based Learning Tool Development
The game-based learning tool development dwells also on the
development of casual games specifically for toddlers with simple,
easy, short and designed for repeated playing. Casual games can be
distinguished by their simple rules. The main concept of this study is to
develop a knowledge recalling game for toddlers in Android.
<br>7.1.1 Development of the Modules
On this phase, the proponents gathered modules from
Little Champ Schoolhouse in creating and developing a memory
game with storylines in helping the children understand the right
functions of the application by decorating its user interface with
the use of the research of Thomas Malone’s Intrinsically
Motivating Instruction. In implementing it, a storyline was
created basing on the Kishotenketsu Model regarding on how the
application flows basing of the storyline created.
<br>7.1.2 User Interface Development
A research study of Gilutz and Black from the Columbia
University in New York was used as basis in the creation of the
user interface of the application. In their research some
guideline were shown that should be acknowledge before the
implementation so the proponents of this study used those
guidelines upon the creation of the user interface using the
following: Corona SDK, Lua, SublimeText, and Adobe Photoshop.
<br><br>7.2 Testing/Survey of the Learning Tool
<br>7.2.1 Testing Phase
The finished product will be tested to the toddler’s for
survey to
be conducted to the teachers of the Little Champ Schoolhouse.
<br>7.2.2 Conduct Survey for Teachers
Survey forms will be provided to the teachers for some
questions regarding the principles of HCI (Accessibility,
Affordance, Usability) of the application made for toddlers if it
had met the applications goal. The teachers are surveyed on
how they see the application for the toddlers.
<br><br>7.3 Evaluation of the Learning Tool
<br>7.3.1 Analysis from the Survey gathered
Analysis from the calculated results from the teacher’s
surveyed will tell if this study will work for toddlers or there
should be improvements should be done in order to meet the
expected results for this study.
<br>
<br>
<b>Expected Results and Discussion</b>
<br>
Game-based learning tool is one of the most common concept in smart
devices. A lot of educational games are widely spread and created in the
market and has a lot of same concepts in terms of their game play. The main
concept of this research is to provide a memory game using different
approaches in creating the proposed capstone. Kishotenketsu Model
provides good guidelines on how to create storylines most especially in
narrative form for a better understanding of what was being shown for the
better understanding of the players.
Thomas Malone’s Intrinsically Motivating Instruction: challenge,
fantasy, and curiosity – will be the key characteristics in engaging on the
Game-Based Learning. An additional concept like, color schemes, scoring
mechanism, positive words and etc. will also be implemented in this
application.
The expected result of this application is to have an effective and
useful memory game application for toddlers in helping them learn the basic
knowledge to be known and be enhanced in the future. With this application,
toddlers will be more enticed to play and learn from this application.

<b>Technology Background</b>
<br>
Game-Based Learning (GBL) or the so-called Educational Games are
the most common concept in creating application in markets for smart
devices. GBL can provide challenging experiences that promote the intrinsic
satisfaction of the players, keeping them engaged and motivated. GBL is also
categorized into two areas: Casual Games and Simulation Games. Casual
Games are simple, easy to play, short and designed for repeated play. This
type of game is an ideal for knowledge type of games, which will also be with
the same concept in this research study.
This Game-Based Learning Tool will be created in Android using the
Corona Software Development Kit. Corona SDK allows programmers to create
applications in iPhone and most especially in Android, where this study will be
created. Corona integrates with Lua in building its graphic application, which
will be created in Sublime Text. Adobe Photoshop will also be used in
enhancing its Graphical User Interface (GUI) to help the players of the
application will be captivated with the graphics embedded in the created
application.
In building the main concept of the application, Kishōtenketsu Model
will be used as basis in creating this application. The model consists of four
basic stages: Introduction, Development, Twist, and Conclusion. In creating
the application, these four stages will be used in creating a simple story
regarding the graphics and images used in the application so that the players
can understand easily what this application is all about. Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI) principles will also be used in creating this application.
Accessibility, Affordance, and Usability of this application is highly needed to
be looked up for the players of this application are the toddlers who depends
much on the graphics and on how they saw the images will create an
interpretation on their mind and create their own understanding on what it is,
its usability will be tested it the graphics make the children understand what
they are doing. Modules from Little Champ Schoolhouse will also be used as
basis for the different exercises to be played in the application.
Thomas Malone’s framework on Intrinsically Motivating Instruction
focuses on challenge, fantasy, and curiosity that will be used as an approach
in understanding the game developed for toddlers. According to Eifferman
(1994), a game is a steady game if each participant can adjust the level of
challenge to their abilities while still leaving the outcome of each round of the
game undetermined. A game should be challenging to the users of the
application to use their abilities and achieve the goal of the created
application and also to develop their self-esteem. Fantasy is an attempt to
assimilate experience into existing structures in the child’s mind. Intrinsic
fantasies not only stimulate interest, they can also provide instructionally
useful analogies. Curiosity is the most important feature of an Intrinsically
Motivating Environment; it is to arouse and satisfy the participants of the
game. To engage a learner's curiosity, feedback should be surprising. And to
be educational, feedback should be constructive. With the framework by
Malone, he generated a specific set of heuristics for the increase of the
appeal of the instructional computer games. Environments that vary in
difficulty level increase both challenge and potential for learning and
environments that evoke cognitive curiosity and then satisfy it can be both
captivating and educational.
