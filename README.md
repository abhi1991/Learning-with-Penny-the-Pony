<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
Nowadays, many technological applications are flooding the market
most especially applications providing game-based learning or the so called
educational learning most especially for toddlers. GBL is a type of game
play that has defined learning outcomes. Some applications provide same
kind of concepts in their in their learning tool games. The main purpose of
this research paper is to provide a Game-Based Learning (GBL) tool using a
casual game approach, which is ideal for knowledge recalling. This GBL tool
will be based on the syllabus of the Little Champ Schoolhouse – a toddler
school located at Dona Candelaria St., Ecoland Subdivision, Davao City. The
key characteristics of an engaging Game-Based Learning was derived from
Thomas Malone’s Intrinsically Motivating Instruction Framework, which dwells
with the following: challenge, fantasy, and curiosity. Corona Software
Development Kit will be used in the development of this game-based
learning application in Android.
